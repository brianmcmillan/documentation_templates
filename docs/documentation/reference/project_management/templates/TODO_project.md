title: To Do { Project }
---
<!---
The to do list document is a list of the tasks to be done on a project. This document is one of many ways a team may decide to capture and track the work to be done. Each team should experiment and discover the method that is most effective for them. One goal to keep in mind, is that any tracking tool should facilitate the communication of the planned, unplanned, and deferred work to be done with stakeholders.

    **Business Contact Name:** { name }  
    **Business Contact email:** { email }  
    **Technical Contact Name:** { name }  
    **Technical Contact email:** { email }  
    **Other stakeholders:** { email }

### High level story
<!--- These are the high level business stories identified during the opportunity phase. Initially, it may be helpful to pick only one story to get development started.--->
!!! summary "Story 1 - Title"
    **IN ORDER TO** { ... }  
    **AS A** { ... }  
    **I WANT** { ... }  
    **GIVEN** { ... }  
    **WHEN** { ... }  
    **THEN** { ... }  

### Slices
<!--- Break the project down into a number of vertical slices that can be deployed as completed functional units. They should represent core functionality and be as small as possible. Slices that you have never been implemented before should be worked on before slices that are well understood.  --->
- [ ] { Functional slice description 1 }  
- [x] { Functional slice description 2 }  
- [ ] { Functional slice description 3 }  

### TO DOs
<!--- Break each slice into the tasks required to complete the slice. Identify the tasks that have been accepted. As the iteration progresses, new tasks may be identified, or modified; including tasks that are outside of the scope of the project. --->
#### { Functional slice description 1 }
- [x] { * accepted } { Task description }  
- [ ] { Task description }  
- [ ] { Task description }  

#### { Functional slice description 2 }
- [ ] { Task description }  
- [ ] { Task description }  
- [ ] { Task description }  

#### Unscoped
- [ ] { Task description }  
- [ ] { Task description }  
- [ ] { Task description }  

### Tracking
#### Weekly Flow
<!--- Each day, record the number tasks in each stage of the delivery process and the cumulative quantity of delivered tasks. This information can be used to build a cumulative flow diagram to assist in analyzing work in process (WIP) and estimated cycle time. --->
| Week End Date | Accepted WIP | Build WIP | Count Delivered (#/wk) | 
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| { YYYY-MM-DD } | { # } | { # } | { # } |

#### Individual Tasks
<!--- Record the date each task is accepted, started, and finished. Tracking these dates are important to understanding the time it takes to complete an individual work item. Collectively, this data can be used to identify process shifts and improvement opportunities. Additionally, this data can be used to provide estimates for the completion of future tasks (e.g.; 85% of our work completes in 12 days or less).--->
| Work Item | Start Date | Finish Date | Tags |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| { ... } | { YYYY-MM-DD } | { YYYY-MM-DD } | { ... } |

### References and notes
<!--- Is there any additional information that would be useful? --->
