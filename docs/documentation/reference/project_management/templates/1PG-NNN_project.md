The 1-Pager is used to record the high level problem and associated requirements for a potential project. This document will be used to help facilitate prioritization decisions. NOTE: This document is only one potential method for documenting this information and the team will need to figure out what process and documents work best in their particular situation.

### Prioritization Scoring
<!--- At this point in the project life cycle, we are estimating the rough costs associated with this feature for prioritization purposes only. The scoring values are always in the context of other opportunities and should be rescored on each evaluation.  --->

<!---One scoring method is to use a modified Fibonacci sequence for each value (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21). Benefits and Urgency are scored highest to lowest (lowest benefit = 1) and Duration is scored lowest to highest (e.g. shortest duration = 1). See Ch. 9: Final Iteration - Innovation and Planning in the book "Building Data Products: Introduction to Data and Analytics Engineering for non-programmers"  
|Benefit Value (B) | Urgency Value (U) | Duration Value (D) | Score (B*U)/D) |
|---|---|---|---|
|{ # }|{ # }|{ # }|{ # }|
--->

<!---An alternative scoring method: The value assigned to the project is determined by providing each stakeholder an equal amount of money to spend on any of the features being evaluated with this process. The total amount in the pool is determined by multiplying the number of developers times the number of months in the timeframe (e.g. 10 developers * 3 months * $5 = $150 total). If you have five people making the prioritization decisions, then the $150 is divided by five. This provides each person $30 to vote with. --->

**Resource estimate:** { XX people }  
**Time estimate:**  { XX time }  
**Feature cost:** { $5 per FTE per month * time * people }  

### Final business value score: { $ ## }
