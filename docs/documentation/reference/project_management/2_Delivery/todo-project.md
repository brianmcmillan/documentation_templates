title: To Do { Project }
---
<!---
The to do list document is a list of the tasks to be done on a project. This document is one of many ways a team bay decide to capture and tract the work to be done. Each team should experiment and discover the method that is most effective for them. One goal to keep in mind is that any tracking tool should facilitate the communication of the planned, unplanned, and deferred work to be done with stakeholders.

<!--- Break the project down into a number of vertical slices that can be deployed as completed functional units. They should represent core functionality and be as small as possible. Slices that you have never implemented before should be worked on before slices that are well understood.  --->
### Slices
*  { ... }  
*  { ... }  
*  { ... }  

### TO DOs
#### { Slice 1 }
- [x] { * accepted } { Task description }  
- [ ] { Task description }  
- [ ] { Task description }  

#### { Slice 2 }
- [ ] { Task description }  
- [ ] { Task description }  
- [ ] { Task description }  

#### Unscoped
